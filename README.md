Hello! 

My name is Stormy Swann, I am from Duluth, Minnesota, and I am obtaining my A.A. degree at Lake Superior college before transfering to a 4-year university for Computer Science.
I like to read a lot in my spare time, with one of my all time favorite short stories being "The Ones Who Walked Away From Omelas" by Ursula K. Le Guin.
